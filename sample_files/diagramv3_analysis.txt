DIAGRAMv3	GWAS	Type 2 Diabetes 	DIAGRAMv3_T2D	"The meta-analysis consists of 12,171 T2D cases and 56,862 controls across 12 GWAS from European descent populations. Please note that the summary statistics presented in this file have not been corrected for a second round of genomic control after meta-analysis. Should you wish to double genomic control the association summary statistics, the inflation factor from the meta-analysis is lambda=1.10. frequency (MAF). The following 3-tiered filter was defined for SNP call rate and minor allele frequency (MAF) for SNPs in the Filtered release set.Criteria for Passing a SNP:0.01= 99%.0.05= 97%.0.10>=MAF and call rate >= 95%. 5 or more Mendelian errors are observed, data are not included.
