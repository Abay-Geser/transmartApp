TITLE	DIAGRAMv3 GWAS meta-analysis
DESCRIPTION	The meta-analysis consists of 12,171 T2D cases and 56,862 controls across 12 GWAS from European descent populations. Samples were typed with a range of GWAS genotyping products. Sample and SNP quality control (QC) were undertaken within each study. Each GWAS was then imputed at up to 2.5M SNPs using CEU samples from Phase II of the International HapMap Project. Each SNP with MAF>1% passing QC was tested for association with T2D under an additive model after adjustment for study-specific covariates including indicators of population structure. Full details of genotyping, QC and imputation for each study are presented in Supplementary Table 1 of Morris et al. (2012). Please note that the summary statistics presented in this file have not been corrected for a second round of genomic control after meta-analysis. Should you wish to .double genomic control. the association summary statistics, the inflation factor from the meta-analysis is lambda=1.10.
